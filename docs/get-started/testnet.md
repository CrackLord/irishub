# Join The Testnet

Since the launch of mainnet, **Fuxi Testnet** starts to operate as a stable application testnet which has the same version as the mainnet, so that the service providers of IRISnet can develop their apps on or interact with IRIShub without running a node or lcd instance.

## Fuxi Testnet

There are no options to run nodes to connect to the Fuxi Testnet, you can use the public RPC to develop and test your apps.

- RPC: <http://rpc.testnet.irisnet.org:80>

- Explorer: <https://testnet.irisplorer.io>
